- I ran into some errors at the very beginning when importing the JSON file. I used [this](https://superuser.com/questions/1496076/mongodb-mongoimport-uncaught-exception-syntaxerror-unexpected-token-identif) website to help debug. Essentially I was trying to use my import code in a terminal window that was running Mongo instead of a new terminal window inside the "Resources" folder.
- I also looked into multiple websites to find the best way to demonstrate that the Lat/Long and Rating Value data had been changed to double or integer, but found that simply printing one document to view these fields seemed to be the most straight forward.
